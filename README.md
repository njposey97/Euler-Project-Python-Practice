# Euler-Project-Python-Practice
Attempting to teach myself python through problem application I found a website called projecteuler.net which contains many 
different mathematical problems to be solved.  In order to learn the Python language, I am attempting many of these problems.  
I do not take credit for the creation of these problems, but, as far as I know, my solutions are original.
